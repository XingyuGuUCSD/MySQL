Section 3 final project!

Create a table with your four best friends first names, last names and their birthdays.
Create a report which will return the following:
1. First and last name together in one column
2. Current Age
3. Create a column - if birthday is today, return ‘Call Today’, else if birthday is less than 14 days, display ‘Send Card”, else display Birthday is in (name of month).
